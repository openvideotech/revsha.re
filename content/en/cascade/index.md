There are two implementations of Nic Wistreich's [Cascade design](https://openvideo.tech/cascade/) for building a multi-step, multi-payee [RSL](/rsl/) based-agreement:
 - **Waterfall** – minimal and framework free, built by [Mark Boas](http://maboa.co/): [github.com/openvideotech/cascade](https://github.com/openvideotech/cascade) ([demo](https://openvideo.tech/cascade/))
 - **Cascade** – realtime responsive, building on this, compiled in [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), with unit tests, by [Rich Lott](https://artfulrobot.uk)
