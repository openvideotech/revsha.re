[Revenue Sharing Language (RSL)](/docs/rsl/) agreements are implemented across three CiviCRM extensions:
 - **CiviSplit Agreement Builder** - extension to create, save and generate income sharing agreements.
 - **CiviSplit Processor** - extension to calculate and process amounts owed to different process
 - **CiviSplit Uphold Payments** – a payment processor to create sub-accounts in [Uphold.com](https://uphold.com), check balances for them and make payouts to IBAN bank accounts (requires an Uphold API key).

 {{< alert icon="❓" text="<strong>Why Uphold?</strong> It's one of only two payment processors at present to have implemented ILP <a href=\"https://paymentpointers.org/\" target=\"_blank\">Payment Pointers</a> and sub-accounts for ringfenced income receipts (the other is Gatehub). They are he only with a sufficient third partyy API." />}}
