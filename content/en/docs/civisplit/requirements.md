{{< alert icon="❓" text="<strong>Why CiviCRM?</strong> CiviCRM is the biggest open source CRM for the non-profit sector, used by 1000s of organisations worldwide, and with integrations into the three biggest CMSs. While Revenue Sharing is normally related to profits, we're hoping the link with CiviCRM will inspire users to non-profit causes in their payment distributions." />}}
